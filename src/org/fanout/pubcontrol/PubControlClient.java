// The PubControlClient class allows consumers to publish either synchronously
// or asynchronously to an endpoint of their choice. The consumer wraps a Format
// class instance in an Item class instance and passes that to the publish
// methods. The async publish method has an optional callback parameter that
// is called after the publishing is complete to notify the consumer of the
// result.
